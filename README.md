# The Impostor Game

TODO: Intro

## Rules of the game

The moderator (i.e. the app) asks each player a question in secret. All players but one get the same question. One player gets a different question, but which will have a similar answer. For example, the "official" question could be "name a movie that you think is overrated", but one player is asked to name his favourite movie.

The "official" question is then revealed, along with the answers from all players. Players can now discuss their aswers before voting (in secret) on whom they think is the "impostor", i.e. the one who answered a different question.

If the impostor receives more votes than any other player, the other players win. Otherwise the impostor wins.

## How to play

Start by entering the names of all the players into the app. Then follow the instructions displayed on the screen.
